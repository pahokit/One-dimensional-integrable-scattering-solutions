This Wolfram Mathematica notebook represents how models from different parts of physics can be mapped onto each other. This work was in the focus of my Master's thesis, its abstract can be read below.

"In this thesis we study the Ruijsenaarsâ€“Schneider model and the sine-Gordon field theory both in the classical context and in infinite volume, paying close attention to the 2-particle solutions and highlighting the relations that provide a bridge between the two theories."
